This is EVI 1.0 release candidate 1. Some minor things are not yet done.
This is not such a "huge" release as the 1.0 might suggest, remember the "rc1".
So there probably follow some other release candidates.

Description
-----------
EVI is a modular everything-capable Java application. The focus is supporting 
IRC (Internet Relay Chat) with several gimmics and possibly also other 
communication protocols such as ICQ. Nevertheless, almost every graphical 
application might be realized as EVI module.
