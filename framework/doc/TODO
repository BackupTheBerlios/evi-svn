    Improve priorities!

    Java Web Start is very nice, but doesn't load the evi.jar classes
    properly? The org.schwering.evi.core.IModuleInfo interface for 
    example is not properly loaded globally and therefore loading a 
    module results in a ClassNotFoundException because it implements 
    this class.
