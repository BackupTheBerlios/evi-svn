    Fix HTMLPane error pages. Document.getElement does not work?!

    Introduce priorities for IButtonable, IMenuable [and IApplet?].
    Additional interfaces?
    Random order of buttons/menus results from Hashtable in ModuleLoader.
    ModuleLoader could tell each ModuleContainer its index and this 
    index (in the loaded-module-row) could be used as priority, too.
