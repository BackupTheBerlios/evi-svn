	EVI 1.0, release candidate 1. Some things are still missing, like an 
	icon and nice error pages in HTMLPane, but the functionality should 
	be complete. Currently, no additions are planned.
	It's time to write modules.

	Completed framework with a major revision of org.schwering.evi.core.

	Mike's Pong just ran for the first time. It's the first real running 
	module -- without any problems!
	The framework is almost complete. There's still the issue with
	configurable modules to solve. And the configuration-gui is still 
	missing, too.

	Now 4800 lines are written. Most of the basic GUI is complete. The 
	core should almost be finished, there's just one problem with 
	configurable modules.

	First 2000 lines written. The org.schwering.evi.core seems to work 
	more or less. Some other utilities work, too. The basic GUI works 
	basically :-).

	Can't sleep because of the idea. At four 'o clock I fall asleep. 
	Development starts.
