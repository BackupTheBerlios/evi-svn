TicTacToe is the simply game with a 3x3 board and two players both trying to get three fields in a row.
</p>
<p>
TicTacToe itself is quite easy to implement. Three years ago I implemented a multiplayer-version of TicTacToe, I don't remember whether it was also singleplayer-capable. Nevertheless, TicTacToe is not to be underestimated. One should think about it before writing it.
</p>
<p>
I'm gonna rewrite it, however, because I want TicTacToe to support the following:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>singleplayer</li>
<li>nultiplayer via direct connection (brings up the port-problem)</li>
<li>multiplayer via instant IRC and ICQ</li>
<li>possibly also multiple games at once?</li>
</ul>
<p>
For the multiplayer stuff we just need an interface and the respective implementations.
