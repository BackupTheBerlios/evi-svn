=What's evi()?=
evi() is a Framework written in Java and based on the Swing Toolkit. 
The goal is to develop a bunch of modules for **internet communication**, **entertainment** and some **tools**.
The list of planned modules includes IRC and ICQ modules, games like Pong and tools like a calculator.

evi() is free software and licensed under the GNU GPL.

You might notice that all components are no new inventions. What makes the difference is that we want to bring them all under one umbrella. The result should be a platform independent workbench for many simple but daily tasks.

==The Name==
evi() is an acronym and means **E**xtensible **V**erena **I**nterface. The names Verena and Evi are allusions to Verena Baumeister respectively Eva Valder from Euskirchen respectively Palmersheim, Germany.
